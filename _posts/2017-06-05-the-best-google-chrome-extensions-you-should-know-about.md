[Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/){:rel="nofollow"} is the most popular Web browser, with more than 50 percent of the market. Here's my list of personal favourite free Chrome extensions you might be interested for potential Internet browsing.

*Note:* Browser extensions are useful but using too many extensions may slow down your browser. So, use only esstential extensions you need most.

#### 1. [Data Saver](http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/data-saver/pfmgfdlgomnbgkofeojodiodmgpgmkac?hl=en){:rel="nofollow"}

If you're using Internet on a monthly basis data plan, then Google's Data Saver extension helps you to save some amount of bandwidth. By enabling this extension, Chrome will use Google servers to compress pages you visit before downloading them. But, due to privacy pages accessed using private connections (HTTPS) or in incognito tabs will not be optimised or seen by Google.

You can also enable Data Saver on Mobile Chrome on Android from the Settings menu.
