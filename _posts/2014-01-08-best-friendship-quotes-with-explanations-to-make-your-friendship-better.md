<blockquote>
<p>With true friends, even water drunk is sweet enough.</p>
<cite>Chinese Proverb</cite></blockquote>

<p>Well, nobody can deny the fact that friendship makes life worth living. No matter how hostile circumstances turn out to be, if you have a friend beside you, things do not seem so bad. They are the ones who support us throughout and act as pillars of strength when we have absolutely no motivation to keep moving.</p>

<p>Friendship is the only cement that will ever hold the world together.</p>
<cite>Woodrow Wilson</cite></blockquote>

Friendship is the concept that could definitely make the world a better place to live in. Fellow feeling for each other makes us realize how important it is to coexist in peace and live in harmony.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Friendship needs no words.</p>
<cite>Dag Hammerskjold</cite></blockquote>

<p>The basic principal behind a true friendship is complete understanding that exists between the individuals. This builds over a period of time and little things about the other person opens a window to his/her heart. The best part about friendship is the fact that you do not have to make yourself understood with the help of a lot of words. Communication here takes place through sentiments and sympathy for each other.</p>

<p>Few delights can equal the mere presence of someone we utterly trust.</p>
<cite>George MacDonald</cite></blockquote>

<p>In the present times, it is extremely difficult to trust a person. Everywhere you look, you will find a group of opportunists who are gearing up to move ahead in life at your cost. Your friend on the other hand is someone whom you can bet your life on. He/she will never let you down and provide you with that much needed feeling of security. Even if the whole world goes against you, your friend will always be there to guide and support you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they are always there.</p>
<cite>Anonymous</cite></blockquote>

<p>There are a lot of people who have had to relocate for a career or for other reasons. But that certainly does not mean that the distance affects the friendships of a person in an adverse manner. Though you might not be able to meet them often or call them every now and then, in your heart you will know that they will be by your side whenever you need them the most. You might be out of sight but nothing can take you out of their minds. Friendship binds two hearts in a bond of love and there is absolutely nothing that can come between them.</p>
