Buying a new laptop is never easy, especially when you are confronted with a sea of options. Other than the basic functioning of a laptop, most of us don’t know squat of what’s going on inside the laptop. It is not just the budget or the general look of the laptop that should matter, but even the model, RAM and its specifications should make a difference. Here are a few basic points that you need to look into when buying a laptop.

#### Know your requirements

Start off by knowing exactly what purpose your laptop is going to serve. If you are just going to use it for general purposes then you will not need a laptop as powerful as the one that is used by graphic designers. Knowing your requirements will help narrow down your search, which in turn will make the choice easy.

#### Portability

The average screen size of a laptop is 12.1 to 14.4 inches. But, if you tend to travel a lot then it is a good idea to get your hands on smaller notebooks. Their average screen size is 10 inches and they are easy to carry; they are also lighter and far cheaper. However, if your work requires you to stay put in a place then regular laptops make more sense for you. Regular laptops have better speed and power.

#### Battery life

Working on a laptop that has a battery which keeps draining can be painful. That’s why it is important to put your cash in a system that gives good battery backup. For instance, if you have your eyes on a 15 inch laptop then make sure it gives at least 4 hours’ power conveyance and for a portable notebook, it should be minimum 6 hours. Really powerful laptops can give you battery life anywhere between 10 to 20 hours.

#### Display

You will have two options in display — the cheap dual scan display and the improved TFT displays. If your work does not involve you to use more than Word and Excel, then go for the cheaper one. And for visual graphics, the improved TFT displays make better sense.

#### Processor

Ever tried working on a laptop that takes ages to download a page and works at a snail’s pace? It’s a nightmare! The speed of your laptop basically depends on the processor. The better the processor, the faster your laptop will work. Even if it pushes your budget a bit too much, make sure to buy a laptop with a good processor.

#### RAM

Memory is the most important thing to consider when buying a laptop. Even the cheapest of laptops these days comes with 1 GB RAM. So, don’t settle for anything less and buy a laptop with 4 GB minimum, as it will enable you to run multiple applications without slowing down the system.

#### Keyboard

Never underestimate the importance of the keyboard when buying a laptop. It can make or break the deal. If you tend to do a lot of typing, run your fingers on the keyboard to see the comfort level. And in case you have pets around your home, make sure you buy a keyboard with keys placed close together or else your pet can easily pluck them out.

Don’t just believe everything the manufacturer claims. It is wise to check reviews online first before you make your choice. And before you discard your old laptop, give it for servicing first; you will manage to get a better resale value.
