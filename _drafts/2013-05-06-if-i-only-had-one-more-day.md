If I only had one more day<br>
I would hold my family tight<br>
I would tell them how much I needed them<br>
When things just weren’t right.

If I only had one more day<br>
I would hug each and every friend<br>
I would thank them for caring about me<br>
And sticking with me till the end.

If I only had one more day<br>
I would give every teacher a pat on the back<br>
I would praise them for what they have taught me<br>
Because now knowledge is something I don’t lack.

If I only had one more day<br>
I would salute our country’s defence<br>
I would honour them for protecting me<br>
And being brave when times were tense.

If I only had one more day<br>
I would look up at the moon and the stars<br>
I would find beauty in all that surrounded me<br>
And I would realise heaven isn’t too far.

If I only had one more day<br>
I would pray to God for more time<br>
To accept that life is a gift<br>
He gave me<br>
And mine’s worth every dime.

If I only had one more day<br>
I would appreciate the ordinary things<br>
I would realise something has to be taken away<br>
Before we found out how much happiness it brings.

If I only had only had one more day<br>
There wouldn’t be enough time to appreciate all that’s mine<br>
So I have to start looking now before time’s up<br>
I know there is so much to shine.
