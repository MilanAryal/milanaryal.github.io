“When I come to the end of my journey<br>
And I travel my last weary mile<br>
Just forget if you can, that I ever frowned<br>
And remember only the smile

Forget unkind words I have spoken<br>
Remember some good I have done<br>
Forget that I ever had heartache<br>
And remember I’ve had loads of fun

Forget that I’ve stumbled and blundered<br>
And sometimes fell by the way<br>
Remember I have fought some hard battles<br>
And won, ere the close of the day

Then forget to grieve for my going<br>
I would not have you sad for a day<br>
But in summer just gather some flowers<br>
And remember the place where I lay

And come in the shade of evening<br>
When the sun paints the sky in the west<br>
Stand for a few moments beside me<br>
And remember only my best.”

― Mrs. Lyman Hancock
