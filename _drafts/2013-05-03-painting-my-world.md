I keep my paint brush with me<br>
Wherever I may go,<br>
In case I need to cover up<br>
So the real me doesn’t show.

I’m so afraid to show you me,<br>
Afraid of what you’ll do, that<br>
You might laugh or say mean things.<br>
I’m afraid I might lose you.

I’d like to remove all my paint coats<br>
To show you the real, true me,<br>
But I want you to try and understand,<br>
I need you to accept what you see.

So if you’ll be patient and close your eyes,<br>
I’ll strip off all my coats real slow.<br>
Please understand how much it hurts<br>
To let the real me show.

Now my coats are all stripped off.<br>
I feel naked, bare and cold,<br><br>
And if you still love me with all that you see,<br>
You are my friend pure as gold.

I need to save my paint brush, though,<br>
And hold it in my hand,<br>
I want to keep it handy<br>
In case someone doesn’t understand.

So please protect me, my dear friend<br>
And thanks for loving me true,<br>
But please let me keep my paint brush with me<br>
Until I love me, too.
